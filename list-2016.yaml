abstract: 'This article examines the methodology of a core branch of contemporary
  political theory or philosophy: “analytic” political theory. After distinguishing
  political theory from related fields, such as political science, moral philosophy,
  and legal theory, the article discusses the analysis of political concepts. It then
  turns to the notions of principles and theories, as distinct from concepts, and
  reviews the methods of assessing such principles and theories (e.g. the reflective-equilibrium
  method), for the purpose of justifying or criticizing them. Finally, it looks at
  a recent debate on how abstract and idealized political theory should be, and assesses
  the significance of disagreement in political theory. The discussion is carried
  out from an angle inspired by the philosophy of science.'
